Project Alisa Bosconovitch:

The main point of this website is to enchant the readers to pick up Alisa Bosconovitch in tekken7 and also to allow them to develop a general intrest in tekken by showing some lore and stories.

Design Process:

This Website is for Tekken players or people who are intrested in tekken.
Tekken players who would like to pick up a new character to learn can look at the website and the guides on it to get a general understanding or a more detailed look at Alisa.

Features

.Allows users to see the physical appeal of the character by displaying a gallery of customisations

.Allows users to understand the lore behind the character

.Allow users to buy the game or visit the web page if they are intrested by having a button that links to the tekken website

.Allows user interaction through email by displaying email and making a form to input their email
