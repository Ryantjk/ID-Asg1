<div id="storyline">
    <p>An android created by Dr. Bosconovitch as a bodyguard for Jin Kazama.<br> Her design itself is modeled after Bosconovitch's own lost daughter.<br> Her fighting capabilities are extremely high. She can perform attacks with high mobility using arm-mounted missiles and thrusters.</p>
    <p>Unlike most robots, Alisa possesses emotions and acts more like a human than a robot. She is a very kind-hearted individual who speaks in a polite manner and is sensitive to others' feelings. Alisa can also appear rather childish, resembling Ling Xiaoyu characteristically. She does not like to fight or hurt anyone, but when push comes to shove, she is a formidable fighter.</p>
